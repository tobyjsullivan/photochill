    			<li>You're terrified your external drive is going to die, break or get stolen</li>
    			<li>You're wasting time sorting which wo keep and which to delete</li>

    		<h3>Never Too Much</h3>
    		<p>You can't take too many photos. We understand that each and every click of your shutter is 
    		adding value to the world. That's why our most basic plan lets you store 20,000 RAW photos.</p>
    		<p>Need even more? There is no limit to how many photos you can store. You can take that as a challenge.</p>

    		<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works/The Small Print</h2>
    		<p>In order to provide the best possible service for keeping your RAW 
    		photos, we use a special storage mechanism that has some interesting 
    		characteristics you'll probably want to know about.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div class="span4">
    		<h3>Thawed Photos</h3>
    		<p>When you upload a photo, we'll keep it "thawed out" and readily 
    		available.</p>
    		<p>This doesn't mean much other than you can download that photo 
    		anytime you want without delay. However, this method of storage is 
    		expensive and we want you to be able to store as many photos as possible 
    		so we only keep your most recent photos (300 for the Hobbiest plan) thawed.
    		After that, we start "freezing" your photos.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div class="span4">
    		<h3>Frozen Photos</h3>
    		<p>In order to let your store tens of thousands of photos (30,000 for the 
    		Hobbiest plan), we "freeze" all your photos other than your most recent few 
    		hundred. This means your photos need to "thaw out" before you can get them.</p>
    		<p>Once you've decided you want to use an old RAW photo that's currently 
    		frozen, you come to RAW Chill and tell us to thaw it. After about five hours,
    		we'll email you and let you know that your photo is thawed and ready for
    		download.</p>
    	</div>
    	<div class="span4">
    		<h3>Upload Speeds</h3>
    		<p>On a slightly more technical note, RAW Chill is based on the requirement 
    		that you upload large files. To ensure maximum satisfaction with our service,
    		we recommend you have an internet plan that provides you with a minimum of
    		2Mbps "upload" speed. If you are not sure, you can call your internet service
    		provider to determine what you have or how you can get this. RAW Chill will
    		still work on slower connections, it might just be a bit slow.</p>
